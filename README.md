# Replication Package For Paper: Enhancing Change Impact Prediction by Integrating Evolutionary Coupling with Software Change Relationships

**IMPER** is a change <u>**I**</u>mpact <u>**P**</u>rediction method that integrates <u>**E**</u>volutionary coupling with software change <u>**R**</u>elationships. The approach consists of following four main steps:

1) filtering the relevant transaction set based on the given query $Q$, 2) generating association rules and obtaining the impact candidate set, 3) considering the temporal and spatial change relationships to obtain the impact candidate set, and 4) making a union of these two sets to find the final impact set. 
+ **Step 1: Relevant Transaction Filtering**. Filtering the relevant transaction set based on the given query $Q$. 
+ **Step 2: Association Rule Generation**. Generating association rules and obtaining the impact candidate set.
+ **Step 3: Spatial-Temporal Window Processing**. Considering the temporal and spatial change relationships to obtain the impact candidate set.
+ **Step 4: Candidates Integrating and Ranking**. Making a union of these two sets to find the final impact set.

This project is still in an early stage of development, and we are improving the implementation and documentation.
